# TCleaner

## 📝 Introduction
**TCleaner** is a tool designed to reformat autogenerated transcripts into a structured and readable format. It processes `.vtt` and `.txt` transcript files, ensuring that each speech block is properly formatted with timestamps, speaker names, and continuous speech.

## 📌 Features (Planned)
- Process Zoom transcript files (`.vtt`, `.txt`)
- Format output as:
[00:00:05]
John Doe: Hello everyone!

[00:00:07]
Jane Smith: Hi John, how are you?

- Merge consecutive speech by the same speaker
- Easy-to-use CLI interface

## 🚀 Development Status
The project is in the early development phase. The CLI functionality will be implemented first, followed by improvements and potential GUI integration.
